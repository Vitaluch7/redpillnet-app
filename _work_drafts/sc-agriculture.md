This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

# Reali

> Translating the mobile home buying experience from the iPhone to Android

## With

NewDealDesign

## Brief

- Translate Reali’s iOS app design to Android
- Handoff screens and a style guide for the entire app
- Work with developers to ensure the design is realised

## Why:

Palo Alto based real estate startup Reali had had good success with their iPhone app. A fully mobile home-buying experience. They now needed to expand to Android to reach the full gamut of potential users.

## Results

Happy clients. App went into development. Handoff was praised by developers.

## When

January 2017

In January 2017 I joined the team working on Reali. Their iOS app, designed earlier in the year by NDD, was gaining traction. Enough to invest in building out the Android app. I was assigned as the sole designer on the project: adapting the team’s iOS designs to function and feel at home on Android.

I’d used Android phones on and off for a few years, so was familiar with its patterns and where it differentiated from iOS. The existing iOS design already borrowed heavily from Google’s Material Design, with cards, headers and elevation, typography, etc., so the project was relatively straightforward. The work ended up being in the details: little updates to spacing, different patterns in navigation and form design, and the like. All the designs also had to be tested at multiple screen sizes, to account for the diversity in Android devices.

# Production & hand-off

I redrew all 142 screens of the app in a master Sketch file, complete with a style guide and component library. I handled all the specs and handoff for the development team through Zeplin, making adjustments and answering queries as they came up.

# Learnings

It was fun to get a relatively short, narrowly defined project. It gave the space to really sweat the details and produce a polished end-product. Producing such a quantity of screens proved a good lesson in the value of components and a design system. You could work through the DNA of the app in 5 or so screens, build a component structure to scale that up, then just roll it out across the entire app. Producing this high volume of screens was so, so much faster.
