Through 2018-19, with the help of [Jason Thomas](https://jft.nyc), I cofounded Sow – a marketplace for groceries from local farms. Over 9 months we designed a brand, tested several prototypes, and raised funding.

The project was Sow. An online marketplace for locally grown food. It needed a visual identity to help tell the story of the company, and to look like enough of a thing for people to take it seriously.

# Research

With the overarching goal of making it easier to buy local food, we set out on a mission to learn all we could about local farming. Over the next month we:

- Interviewed farmers, chefs, food policy experts, food journalists, farmers market co-ordinators and everyday consumers. Trying to understand their motivations and the challenges they face.
- Shadowed shoppers as they bought groceries
- Read the leading voices on local farming, including Michael Pollen, Joan Gussow, and J M Fortier.
