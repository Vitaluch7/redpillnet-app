The last of the other diners has just cleared out. I’m tapping away in the corner, on a wobbly plastic table (supplied by the local beer company) in a sort of restaurant/grocery store/front-room mashup.

Picking apart technique, trading friendly digs, swapping stories of *that one wave they got that…*
