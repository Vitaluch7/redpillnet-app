I work across the design end of the product development process. Mostly Research, UX, UI, prototyping, user testing and brand, though I sometimes dip my toes in front-end (HTML/CSS, Javascript, and React).

The past 18 months, I've been helping define and design a swim coaching app with [Swim Smooth](https://swimsmooth.com). Talking with users to understand what we should build, prototyping new features, and seeing them through to production on our [web](https://swimsmooth.com) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/swim-smooth/id1516271521) platforms.

Before going independent, I cofounded [Sow](/sow) â€“ a startup building an easier way to buy groceries from your local farmer. Before that, I led field studies and experiments in education with [Applied Cognitive Science](https://appliedcognitivescience.com) in Laos, Zambia, Ethiopia and Nepal. Before that, I was part of the experience design team at [NewDealDesign](https://newdealdesign.com), in San Francisco. I graduated in Graphic Design from Falmouth, UK.

Talk to me about design, tech, travel, behavioral sciences, surfing, whitewater kayaking, hitchiking, or anything else that takes your fancy. I like friendly emails from strangers!
