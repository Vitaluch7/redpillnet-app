> The first time I visited a Zen monastery, the monks would always clasp their hands. After two days I asked one why. They said, "We believe the world of appearances is an illusion, but for reasons of efficiency, most of the time we have to pretend that it is real. Many times a day, such as before we eat and work, we clasp our hands to pause for a moment to realise that the world is much more complex than our tiny minds can deal with at any one time.

—Alan Kay (2001), found in Adam Brate’s _Technomanifestos_
