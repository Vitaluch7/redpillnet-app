I’m writing this after just getting the announcement email about Hey World. Here I am trying it out!

I’ve long wanted to build a habit of saying stuff online. Always though my brain reacts, ‘but what do I have to say?’ I retreat back to consumption mode

Blogging has felt overly formal when I’ve tried it. Twitter feels like a popularity contest, like taking the stage in a crowded room and having to come up with something worth saying. Facebook and Instagram aren’t places I like hanging out

Perhaps this will be different?
