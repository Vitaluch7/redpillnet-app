summary: "In January 2017 I joined the team within NewDealDesign working on Reali, a Palo Alto based real estate startup. Their iOS app, designed earlier in the year, was gaining traction. Enough to invest in building out the Android app. I was assigned as the sole designer on the project: adapting the team’s iOS designs to function and feel at home on Android."

The existing iOS design already borrowed heavily from Google’s Material Design, with cards, headers and elevation, typography, etc., so the project was relatively straightforward. The work ended up being in the details: little updates to spacing, different patterns in navigation and form design. All the designs were tested at multiple screen sizes, to account for the diversity in Android devices.

# Production & hand-off

I redrew all 142 screens of the app in a master Sketch file, complete with a style guide and component library. I handled all the specs and handoff for the development team through Zeplin, making adjustments and answering queries as they came up.

# Learnings

This project gave the space to really sweat the details and produce a polished end-product. Producing such a quantity of screens proved a good lesson in the value of components and a design system.
