95% of our decisions happen without conscious awareness – split-second, impulsive and easily influenced.

Thinking Inside a Box is a toolkit to help you find creative solutions to problems of human behavior change. It invites you first to frame your problem in simple behavioral terms, then to ideate around a series of prompts—each derived from a heuristic of human behavior. Use it to find creative ways to change the behaviour of your customers, users, audience, friends, parents or children.
